# Data Science at Scale - Capstone Project

## About this Course
In the capstone, students will engage on a real world project requiring them to apply skills from the entire data science pipeline: preparing, organizing, and transforming data, constructing a model, and evaluating results.    Through a collaboration with Coursolve, each Capstone project is associated with partner stakeholders who have a vested interest in your results and are eager to deploy them in practice.  These projects will not be straightforward and the outcome is not prescribed -- you will need to tolerate ambiguity and negative results!  But we believe the experience will be rewarding and will better prepare you for data science projects in practice.
